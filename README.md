# Final-Project-J124
Work for summer final project
# Analysis Process
1. Decide on a topic for Data Analysis, in this case I want to conduct a decade analysis of the City of Escondido's Budget 
2. Brainstorm questions I want to glean from the data, which will determine the data I will need to pull from the archives
* Where has most of the cities budget been allocated to in the past decade? Over the past decade, the police department has received the largest share of most of the city's annual budget every year. The average percentage the police department has been allocated over the past decade is 43%.

* Were there any budget changes due to covid-19? While covid may have affected the budget allocation, the number for the 2021-2022 is not yet available on the website. For the 2020-21 fiscal year there was actually an increase in the overall budget, and it was the highest amount in the past decade: $107,596, 800. Deeper analysis would be needed to determine causation between covid-19 and budgetary changes. 
* What is the average amount of money the police get yearly? The average amount of money that was allocated to the police from 2011-2021 was $38,707,538.64

3. For this data analysis, I needed to find the budget breakdown for the each year for the past 10 years. I headed to city website and they had the annual budgetary analysis for each year easily accesible.
