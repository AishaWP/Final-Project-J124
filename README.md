# Final-Project-J124
Work for summer final project
# Analysis Process
1. Decide on a topic for Data Analysis, in this case I want to conduct a decade analysis of the City of Escondido's Budget 
2. Brainstorm questions I want to glean from the data, which will determine the data I will need to pull from the archives
3. Throughout this process I used tabula to extract data from pdf's into csv files.

* **Where has most of the cities budget been allocated to in the past decade?** 
  * To find this I looked through the budget documents for the past 10 years and took the calculated budget percentages and created a spread sheet. I then took the average of those percentages using the average function on the spreadsheet.
Over the past decade, the police department has received the largest share of most of the city's annual budget every year. The average percentage the police department has been allocated over the past decade is 43%.

* **Has the police department seen an overall increase in its funding over the past decade?** 
 * To find this amount I created a spereate spreadsheet that had the yeraly values of the police department budget allocation for the past 10 years. I then took the minimum and maximum values, and subtracted them to find the difference. 
The police department has seen an overall increase in funding over the past decade, approximately a 13 million dollar increase.

* **Were there any budget changes due to covid-19 in the police department funding?** 
  * While covid may have affected the budget allocation, the number for the 2021-2022 is not yet available on the website. For the 2020-21 fiscal year there was actually an increase in the overall budget, and it was the highest amount in the past decade: $107,596, 800. Deeper analysis would be needed to determine causation between covid-19 and budgetary changes. More specifically, the police department budget was at the second highest amount for the past decade at 45,633,100 million dollars.

* **What is the average amount of money the police get yearly?**
  *Using the spreadhseet that was previously created, I used the sum fucntion and found the average of the amounts.
The average amount of money that was allocated to the police from 2011-2021 was $38,707,538.64

* **How has the City of Escondido's overall budget changed over the past decade?** There has been more than a 33 million dollar increase in the past decade. 
* **Short summary of the story**: 
  * For the past decade, the city of Escondido has had a majority of its budget allocated to the police department. The average percentage of the police department's share of the budget is 43% of the total fund. Despite the changes in mayoral administration and council majorities, the police department has consistently taken the largest share of the budget. While its share of the budget has fluctuated slightly, overall the amount of money it has garnered per year has increased. From fiscal year 2010-11 to 2020-21 the police department has seen over a 13 million dollar increase in budget allocation. I would like to explore why the police department takes such a large share of the annual budget, and why this has been a consistent pattern for the past decade, if not longer. Why does the police department receive more funds than community development, community services, community relations, and public works combined? Where exactly does this money go once it gets in the hands of the police, what is it being spent on, and does the department really need the money? Could it in fact be better spent and put into better use elsewhere? I would like to do a deep dive into the history of policing in Escondido, and the effects that its spotty past has had on its community relations, and its future trajectory. What is the police doing to address these issues.
