# Final-Project-J124
Work for summer final project
# Analysis Process
1. Decide on a topic for Data Analysis, in this case I want to conduct a decade analysis of the City of Escondido's Budget 
2. Brainstorm questions I want to glean from the data, which will determine the data I will need to pull from the archives
* Where has most of the cities budget been allocated to in the past decade? Over the past decade, the police department has received the largest share of most of the city's annual budget every year. The average percentage the police department has been allocated over the past decade is 43%.

* Were there any budget changes due to covid-19 in the police department funding? While covid may have affected the budget allocation, the number for the 2021-2022 is not yet available on the website. For the 2020-21 fiscal year there was actually an increase in the overall budget, and it was the highest amount in the past decade: $107,596, 800. Deeper analysis would be needed to determine causation between covid-19 and budgetary changes. More specifically, the police department budget was at the second highest amount for the past decade at 45,633,100 million dollars.
